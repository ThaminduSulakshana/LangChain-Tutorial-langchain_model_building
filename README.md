# LangChain Chatbot Tutorial

- **LangChain**: LangChain is an open source framework available in Python or JavaScript (TypeScript) packages. It facilitates the integration of Large Language Models with external data, enabling developers to enhance the capabilities of models like GPT-4 by connecting them to custom data and computations.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Models (LLM Wrappers)**: Interact with LLMs by instantiating wrappers for models such as GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4.
  
- **Prompts**: Utilize PromptTemplates to dynamically change prompts with user input, abstracting away repetitive components.

- **Chains**: Create functionality by combining PromptTemplates and LLMs into chains. Chains can be sequentially linked to build complex compositions.

- **Embeddings and Vector Stores**: Break large data into chunks, store them as embeddings, and utilize Vector Stores for efficient querying.

- **Agents**: Develop autonomous agents that take inputs, complete tasks sequentially, and interact with external APIs to perform actions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start building with LangChain:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Load environment variables: Replace API keys for OpenAI, Pinecone Environment, and Pinecone API in the `.env` file.
3. Run the provided code snippets to instantiate models, create prompts, build chains, and set up Vector Stores.
